# Watermarker
Batch watermark a bunch of images automatically

## Dsiclaimer
This script was built pretty quickly, so it does not yet support anything other than JPG and has a couple bugs I'm not yet worried about.

## How to use it
1. Clone the repository
2. Replace the example images with your own
3. Replace the `logos/logo` with your own watermark image
4. Run `bash bay.sh`
5. The watermarked images will be in the `after` folder when complete.
